# Mentality Detection from Text using BERTForSequenceClassification
## Project Overview
Detect mental health-related sentiments from text data using deep learning with the pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` model. The model is trained on Google Colab and deployed as a web app using Streamlit for simplicity and efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Pre-trained Model**: Fine-tuned `BertForSequenceClassification` from Hugging Face.
- **Custom Tokenizer**: Used `BertTokenizer` for text preprocessing.
- **Efficient Training**: GPU-enabled training on Google Colab.
- **Streamlit Deployment**: Web app for real-time sentiment prediction.

## Workflow
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Preprocessed and resampled labeled text data.
2. **Model Training**: Fine-tuned BERT with two sentiment labels using `Trainer` API.
3. **Deployment**: Streamlit app provides real-time predictions.
